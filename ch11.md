# Chapter 11

## True or False

1\. You cannot use nested If-Then-Else statements to perform the action selected by the user from a menu.

False

2\. It is not usually necessary to validate the user’s menu selection.

False

3\. In most cases, a menu-driven program should be modularized.

True

4\. If a menu-driven program does not use a loop to redisplay the menu after each operation, the user will have to rerun the program to select another operation from the menu.

True

5\. In a single-level menu, the user might see a submenu appear when an item from the main menu is selected.


False

## Short Answer

1\. What type of structure do you use in a program to perform the action that the user has selected from a menu?

Typically a switch is used but if-then-else is also an option.

2\. What ways for validating a user’s menu selection did we discuss in this chapter?

Use a default case in a switch statement, else clause in if-then-else, or pre-validate before processing the selection.

3\. How can you design a menu-driven program so that the menu is redisplayed after the selected operation has been performed?

Use a loop to continue displaying the menu unless the user selected a specific value to quit.

4\. What is the difference between a program that uses a single-level menu and a program that uses a multiple-level menu?

A selection on single-level menu items begings a process.  A selection on multi-level menu items can display another menu with further items to select.

5\. When a program has a lot of items for the user to select from, why should you avoid displaying all of the items on one menu?

It's bad UX, can be confusing to the user.

## Algorithm Workbench #2

Design a case structure that can be used with the algorithm you designed for question 1. The case structure should call a module named openDocument if the user selected item 1, should call a module named closeDocument if the user selected item 2, and should call a module named printDocument if the user selected item 3.

```
// Declare a selection var
Declare Integer menuSelection

// Display the menu.
Display "1. Open a new document"
Display "2. Close current document"
Display "3. Print current document"
Display "4. Exit"

// Case Structure
Input menuSelection
Select menuSelection
  Case 1:
    call openDocument();
    break;
  Case 2:
    call closeDocument();
    break;
  Case 3:
    call printDocument();
    break;
  Case 4:
    exit;
  Default:
    Display "Ivalid selection";
End Select
    
```
