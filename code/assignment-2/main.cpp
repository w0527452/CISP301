/**
 * 5. Distance Traveled
    Assuming there are no accidents or delays, the distance that a car travels down the interstate can be
    calculated with the following formula: Distance = Speed Ã— Time

    A car is traveling at a constant 60 miles per hour. Design a program that displays the following:

    The distance the car will travel in 5 hours
    The distance the car will travel in 8 hours
    The distance the car will travel in 12 hours
