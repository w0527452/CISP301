Answer: 11111111

### 2\. Use what you’ve learned about the binary numbering system in this chapter to convert the following binary numbers to decimal:

1101 = 13 =  (1 × 2³) + (1 × 2²) + (0 × 2¹) + (1 × 2⁰)

1000 = 8 =   (1 × 2³) + (0 × 2²) + (0 × 2¹) + (0 × 2⁰)

101011 = 43 =  (1 × 2⁵) + (0 × 2⁴) + (1 × 2³) + (0 × 2²) + (1 × 2¹) + (1 × 2⁰)

### 3\. Look at the ASCII chart in Appendix A and determine the codes for each letter of your first name.

Mark = 077 097 114 107


mark = 109 097 114 107

### 4\. Use the Web to research the history of the BASIC, C++, Java, and Python programming languages, and answer the following questions:

- BASIC
  - John Kemeny, Tom Kurtz
  - 1964
  - To expand the use of computers beyond math/science
- C++
  - Bjarne Stroustrup
  - 1985
  - To improve the C language based on features from Simula
- Java
  - James Gosling
  - 1995
  - Intended to run anywhere that supported Java after being compiled.  No idea what his motivation was.
- Python
  - Guido van Rossum
  - 1991
  - I've no idea what his motivation was.  Probably just scratching an itch he had with existing languages.
