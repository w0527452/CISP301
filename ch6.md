## Short Answer

1\. What is the difference between a module and a function?

A function can return a value.

2\. What three characteristics of a function are described in an IPO chart?

Input, processing and output.

3\. When a conversion function is used to convert a real number to an integer, what usually happens to the real numberâ€™s fractional part?

The fractional part is discarded.

4\. What is a substring?

A string that is part of a larger string.

5\. What is the purpose of the stringToInteger and stringToReal functions described in this chapter?

To ensure input given to a function is of the proper type.

6\. What is the purpose of the isInteger and isReal functions described in this chapter?

To verify that a string can be converted before attempting the conversion.


## Algorithm Workbench #3

A pseudocode program contains the following function definition:

```
Function Integer cube(Integer num)
  Return num * num * num
End Function
```

Write a statement that passes the value 4 to this function and assigns its return value to the variable result.

```
int result = cube(4);
```
