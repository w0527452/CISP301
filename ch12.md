## True or False

1\. When subscripts are used to specify character positions in a string, the first character’s subscript is 0.

True

2\. When subscripts are used to specify character positions in a string, the last character’s subscript is the same as the string’s length.

False

3\. If the String variable str contains the string "Might", then the statement Set str[5] = "y" will change its contents to "Mighty".

False

4\. The insert library module automatically expands the size of the string to accommodate the inserted characters.

True

5\. The delete library module does not actually remove characters from a string, but replaces them with spaces.

False

6\. The isUpper library function converts a character to uppercase, and the isLower library function converts a character to lowercase.

False

7\. An error will occur if you use a subscript on an empty String variable.

True

## Short Answer

3\. If the following pseudocode were an actual program, what would it display?

```
Declare String str = "Yada yada yada"
delete(str, 4, 9)
Display str
```
Yadayada

4\. If the following pseudocode were an actual program, what would it display?

```
Declare String str = "AaBbCcDd"
Declare Integer index
For Index = 0 To length(str) – 1
  If isLower(str[index]) Then
    Set str[index] = "–"
  End If
End For
Display str
```

A-B-C-D-

5\. If the following pseudocode were an actual program, what would it display?

```
Declare String str = "AaBbCcDd"
delete(str, 0, 0)   
delete(str, 3, 3)   aBbCcDd
delete(str, 3, 3)   aBCcDd
Display str
```
aBcDd

## Algorithm Workbench #3

Design an algorithm that counts the number of uppercase characters that appear in the String variable ```str```.

```
declare int count = 0, index = 0;
For index to length(str) -1
  if isUpper( str[index] then
    set count = count + 1
  end if
End For  ```
rettrun count
